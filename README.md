# Case 3: Vigen√®re Cypher
Program should be able to encrypt and decrypt a message provided by user using a key that is also providedby the user. Not only sshould it be able to encrypt, but should also be able to decrypt already encrypted messages using a key that is also provided by the user.

# Instructions For Program
Upon program start the user is prompted to choose between: 1) Encrypt, 2) Decrypt, and 3) Exit Program. The latter terminates the program, of course. Chooisng 1 or 2 prompts the user to enter a message or key, if it was 2, decryption, it would ask for an encrypted message. Pressing any other number leads to a prompt telling the user that they enetered an invalid input. Warning: typing any other character besides a number leads to a constant looping of the table! Choosing encryption or decryption, and giving th eprogram a key and message leads to an output of the encrypted or decrypted message!
